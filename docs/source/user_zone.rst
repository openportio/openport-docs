Key Groups
==========


Key groups are a way to organize keys. Admins can limit access to certain keys by adding them to a key group and assigning
users to that group.

Users will only be able to access keys that are in the key groups they are assigned to.
Users without a key group will have access to all keys.

Admins have access to all keys regardless of key group.

When registering a new key, it will be assigned to the default key group that is configured on the account page.
Admins can set this key group to none. Users that have a key group assigned cannot set this to none.
