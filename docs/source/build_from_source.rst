Build from Source
=================


The openport client is fully open-source.
You can find the source `here <https://github.com/openportio/openport-go>`_

You need to have docker installed.

To compile the code, run

.. code-block::

    docker_compile_all.sh

Once that is done, you can run

.. code-block::

    ./openport-<my-arch> <port>
