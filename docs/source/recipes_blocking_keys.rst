Blocking keys
=============


.. raw:: html

    On the <a href="https://openport.io/user/keys">keys page</a> you can see all your keys. You can block a key by clicking on the
    "Block" (<i class="fa fa-ban"></i>) button. This will prevent the key from being used to connect to Openport. The current connections that use this key
    will be interrupted. The client will keep trying to reconnect in the background. You can unblock a key by clicking on
    the "Unblock" (<i class="fa fa-play-circle"></i>) button. Connections that were interrupted will be re-established after a timeout.
