Opening a port from your PC to the internet might be dangerous, that's why Openport offers the following safety measures to keep you and your PC safe:

- :ref:`Click a link to open a port to your ip <security_ip_link_protection>`
- :ref:`Brute force blocking <security_brute_force_blocking>`
- Http forwards are not transmitted directly to you machine, but are interpreted by the openport servers, and then forwarded. This means there is an extra layer of security between you and the outside world.
- Port scanning detection
