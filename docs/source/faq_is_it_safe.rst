Is it safe
==========

Yes.
Openport is the safest reverse ssh solution on the internet.
Why?
Several security measures have been put in place:

- Port scanning is detected and blocked
- users must click a link first, before the port is opened for their IP (You can change this in your account settings)
- users cannot make more than 10 connections per minute to your port (You can change this in your account settings)
- Http-forward links are interpreted and reconstructed by the openport servers first, which means you are not vulnerable, even with old/unpatched webservers on your end
