Latency
=======

Openport uses multiple servers, spread globally to minimize latency.
Depending on the geographic location of the client device, it will be
assigned a port on any of these servers:

- openport.io (Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
- us.openport.io (San Francisco, USA)
- spr.openport.io (Singapore, Singapore)

Contact us if you need an additional server in your region.
