Openport is a way to access a port from your machine from anywhere in the world.

It was created to service a server behind a firewall using SSH, but it can be used for any TCP protocol.

Use openport if you need to automate servicing many machines, if your IP constantly changes or if you are having troubles with a firewall.

Openport was founded in 2014 by Jan De Bleser (jan at openport dot io).
