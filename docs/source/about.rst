About Us
========

Openport.io is a service that allows you to expose a TCP port on your local server to the internet
without having to open ports in your firewall. It is a secure and easy way to expose your local server to the internet.

Openport was founded in 2014 by Jan De Bleser (jan at openport dot io).

Jan's brothers had just started a business when they needed to set up a server for file sharing (this was before the days of dropbox and google drive). Being the techie he is, Jan set up this server, but occasionally needed to spend time during visits to do some basic maintenance on the server. He set up a simple reverse SSH server to be able to do this from home, so he could spend more quality time with his brother.
Jan realised that more people will have this same problem and created the very first version of Openport.

Initially it was built for hobbyists, but soon it was getting picked up by large service providers that use Openport to reach 1000's of devices.

Our mission is to make it easy for developers to expose their local servers to the internet.
We want to make it easy to test webhooks, websockets, APIs, etc. We want to make it easy to share your local services with your team, your clients, etc. We want to make it easy to deploy of fleet of IoT devices and have them all securely accessible from the internet.

Our vision is to make the lives of developers easier by providing them with the tools they need to do their job. We want to make it easy to develop, test, deploy and maintain software.

We are a small team of developers based in Antwerp, Belgium who are passionate about technology and building great products. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our service and make it better for our users. We are always open to feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or comments.
